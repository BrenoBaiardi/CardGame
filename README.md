# CardGame Prototype

### Concept
This started as a project to train concepts about Objected Oriented programming, and relationships between classes. 

During the first steps of the development, the goal was to create classes able to manage the behavior that could come out when dealing with cards, decks, players taking turns, and a board field.
Some great ideas kept coming and after some talks about game and code designing the goal has changed. Now the aim is at creating a functional game.

### Samples

### Goals to be functional

In order to receive minimum acceptance, the game should have the following prerequisites:

* Be fun - We do not want to develop something that could not be played at all.
* Be simple - Hard games aren't always as fun as they could.
* Be complete - Even in being simple, the concept of functional also intends to cover aspects known to other games.

These are the minimum prerequisites, and if the project goes on, more will be add.

### Quality and testing

For now the code has few classes and consequently its easy to debug.
I order to keep the things running, Unit testing is being made with Junit.
